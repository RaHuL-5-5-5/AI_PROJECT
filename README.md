# An Improved Bat Optimization Algorithm to Solve the Task Scheduling Problem in Open Shop

This project aims to improve the Bat Optimization Algorithm to solve the Task Scheduling Problem in Open Shop. The task scheduling problem is a widely studied optimization problem, and it plays a critical role in many fields, such as manufacturing, logistics, and transportation. The Open Shop scheduling problem is a specific instance of the task scheduling problem, where all tasks need not go through all machines in a specific order.

## How to Run

To run the project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. Then, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the project from the GitHub repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command: `python3 main.py`

The program will run and display the results of the Improved Bat Optimization Algorithm for the Task Scheduling Problem in Open Shop.
